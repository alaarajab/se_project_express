# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Tech Stack / Libraries

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express** – Web framework for routing and middleware
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing users and clothing items
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB, used for schema definition and queries
- **Validator** – Library to validate strings (e.g., URLs)
- **Nodemon** – Development tool for hot reloading
- **ESLint** – Code linting to enforce best practices
- **Jest / Supertest** – Testing framework for API endpoints

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
